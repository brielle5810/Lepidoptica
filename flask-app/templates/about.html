        This is a tool to assist in digitization efforts for the <b>Florida Museum of Natural History McGuire Center</b> by transcribing butterfly specimen labels for the Lepidoptera collection.
        <br><br>
        Users can upload batches of images and our website will attempt to transcribe their text content using machine learning. Next, users can edit the transcriptions from the web interface and save them as a .csv file for bulk uploading to the collection database.<br><br>
