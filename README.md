# TJS_Project

Our goal is to work with curators Andrei Sourakov, Keith Willmott and Vaughn Shirey to extract and structure collection information from butterfly specimen labels to assist in ongoing digitization efforts. We would be working specifically to parse hand-written and less structured data from specimen labels, building upon Shirey’s work that can already interpret printed and well-structured data. If time permits, we would also plan to automate measuring morphological traits in images, such as abdomen length, thorax length and width, wing length and area. The resulting label data will be uploaded to the FLMNH’s Specify database available online for researchers and museums, and morphological data will contribute to ongoing efforts to score traits for butterflies.
